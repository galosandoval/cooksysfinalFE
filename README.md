# cooksysfinalFE


## Here is a project I worked on for Cook Systems. 

This app is designed for users be able to keep track of the people of their team, projects a team is working on, and their profile information.
The features that I worked on include the Login page, the Users, Teams, and Profile tabs, and the logout button. 

A snapshot of what I worked on for this project.
