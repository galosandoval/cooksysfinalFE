# cooksysfinalFE


## Here is a project I worked on for Cook Systems. 

This app is designed for users be able to keep track of the people of their team, projects a team is working on, and their profile information.
I worked on this project as the Frontend Developer with 3 other FE Developers and 4 Backend Developers. I acted as the leader of the FE team and communicated with the leader of the BE team to discuss any progress or problems that arose.

The features that I worked on include the Login page, the Users, Teams, and Profile tabs, and the logout button.
